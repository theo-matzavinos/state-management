[Official docs](https://tanstack.com/query/latest/docs/framework/angular/overview)

Managing server state with client-state-management libs (@ngrx etc) is not the best experience.
Server state is not **OUR** state.

@tanstack/query is a library for data-fetching/server state management.
It handles:

- Caching
- Request deduping
- Background syncing
- Memory management

## Key concepts

- **Queries** are requests that **read** data from the server.
- **Mutations** are requests that **change** data on the server.

### Queries

To create queries we use the `injectQuery` function.
We must provide it with a function that returns an object with at least the `queryKey` and `queryFn` properties.
It returns a `QueryResult` object.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="inject-query.ts">
    <Code code={injectQuery} lang="ts" />
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="query-result.ts">
    <Code code={queryResult} lang="ts" />
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="example-query.ts">
    <Code code={exampleQuery} lang="ts" />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

<Aside>
  The `injectQuery` function expects a function as a parameter because it wraps
  it inside a `computed`. This means that if we're reading from signals and any
  of their values change the query will react and re-run.
</Aside>

#### queryKey

The `queryKey` property is of type `any[]`.
It is used to identify the query for refetching, caching, and sharing so it must be unique.

<Aside>
  Any parameters (pagination, filters, etc) used for the request should be part
  of the `queryKey`.
</Aside>

<Aside type="tip">
  It's good practice to have the static parts of the `queryKey` in the begining
  of the array and the dynamic parts in the end.
</Aside>

#### queryFn

The `queryFn` property can be any function that returns a `Promise`.
This function receives an object that includes the value of the `queryKey`.

#### Query caching

@tanstack/query simulates the browser's `stale-while-revalidate` caching method.
When a request is made it checks if the result exists in the cache.

- If it doesn't exist it makes the request to the server and caches the response.
- If it exists and it is **fresh** it returns the cached result immediately.
- If it exists and it is **stale** it returns the cached result immediately and makes a request to the server to get a **fresh** response and update the cache and the result.

#### Behaviors

By default all cached data is considered **stale**.
This can be configured by the `staleTime` property (in milliseconds).
We can set `staleTime: Infinity` for data that doesn't change (eg. enum values).

**Stale** queries are refetched automatically in the background when:

- New instances of the query mount. Configured by `refetchOnMount`.
- The window is refocused. Configured by `refetchOnWindowFocus`
- The network is reconnected. Configured by `refetchOnReconnect`
- The query is optionally configured with a refetch interval. Configured by `refetchInterval`

To pause/disable a query from automatically running, we can use the `enabled` property.

Queries that fail are silently retried 3 times, with exponential backoff delay before capturing and displaying an error to the UI.
We can control this with the `retry` and `retryDelay` properties.
Setting `retry: false` will disable retries

Query results that have no more active instances are labeled as `inactive` and remain in the cache in case they are used again at a later time.
By default, `inactive` queries are garbage collected after 5 minutes.
This can be configured by the `gcTime` property (in milliseconds).

### Mutations

Mutations are typically used to create/update/delete data or perform server side-effects.

To create mutations we use the `injectMutation` function.
We must provide a function that return an object with at least a `mutationFn` property.
We can also optionally define some hooks/callbacks.
It returns a `MutationResult` object.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="mutation-hooks.ts">
    <Code code={mutationHooks} lang="ts" />
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="inject-mutation.ts">
    <Code code={injectMutation} lang="ts" />
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="mutation-result.ts">
    <Code code={mutationResult} lang="ts" />
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="example-mutation.ts">
    <Code code={exampleMutation} lang="ts" />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

#### mutationFn

The `mutationFn` property can be any function that returns a `Promise`.
If we need parameters for the request we can define them as arguments of this function.

#### Hooks

We can provide callbacks to hook into the lifecycle of the mutation.
This can be done in `injectMutation` or when calling `mutate` on the `MutationResult`.

<Aside>
  Callbacks defined in `injectMutation` will be called for every request.
  Callbacks defined in `mutate` will **only** be called for the last request if
  there are multiple simultaneous request and will not be called if the
  component is destroyed.
