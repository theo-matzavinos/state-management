[Official docs](https://ngrx.io/docs)

@ngrx/store + @ngrx/effects is the most popular state management solution for Angular.

It's an implementation of the Redux pattern using rxjs.

The app's state is stored in a single object exposed through an Observable.

We update the value by dispatching and handling actions.

<Code code={store} lang="ts" />

## Key concepts

- **Actions** that describe unique events.
- **Reducers** that handle events and update the state.
- **Selectors** that are used to read from the store and compute derived values.
- **Effects** for logic that doesn't immediately (or at all) affect state.

### Actions

Actions describe unique events that happen in the application. All actions have a type property which must be unique. Actions can optionally have additional data (payload).

We create action creator functions using the `createActionGroup` function.
To define actions that don't have a payload we can use the `emptyProps` function.
To define actions that have a payload we can use the generic `props` function.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Define actions creators">
    <Code code={exampleActions} lang="ts" />
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Dispatch actions">
    <Code code={dispatchExampleActions} lang="ts" />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

<Aside>
Actions represent unique event types and should not be reused - the action must be identifiable by its **type**, not its payload.
Even if multiple sources dispatch similar actions (same payload) we should create a separate action for each source.
This helps with debugging and makes it easier to have different handling for the actions if necessary.

Actions represent events and not commands. We are saying that something happened, not that something should happen.

</Aside>

<Aside>
  The `props` function only accepts 1 type argument which must be an object.
  `props<number>()` or `props<{ one: string }, { two: number }>()` are invalid.
  Use `props<{ magic: number }>()` or `props<{ one: string, two: number }>()` instead.
</Aside>

### Reducers

We use reducers to define slices/parts/pieces of state.
Reducers define the initial state of the slice they manage and the action handlers which update the state.

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem label="example.reducer.ts">
    <Code code={exampleReducer} lang="ts" />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

<Aside type="caution">
  Action handlers must be **pure functions** and treat state as **immutable**.
  In human words: we must always return a new object when we want to update
  state. **This also applies to nested object/arrays.** `previousValue !==
  newValue` **must** be `true`.
</Aside>

<Aside>
  It's good practice to declare the action handler's return type explicitly. If
  omitted we can accidentally return extra properties that are not part of the
  state's type.
</Aside>

### Selectors

We use selectors to read values from the Store.

We can also compose multiple selectors to derive/compute values.

Selectors are **memoized**. They cache the latest value returned and only recomputed when their input values change.

To create a selector we use the `createSelector` function.
We must provide a **projector** function that recieves the input value and returns the value we want to read.
If we don't provide any input selector(s) the input value is the whole app's state, otherwise it is the result(s) of the input selector(s).

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="create-selector.ts">
    <Code code={createSelector} lang="ts" />
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="example.selectors.ts">
    <Code code={exampleSelectors} lang="ts" />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Effects

We use effects for handling async tasks (ex. http requests) or for tasks that don't update the app's state (ex. showing a toast).

We create effects using the `createEffect` function.
We must provide a function (effect source) that returns an `Observable` and _optionally_ a configuration object.

If the effect source function returns an `Observable<Action>` the actions emmited will be dispatched automatically.
If we don't want to dispatch actions as a result of the effect we must set `dispatch: false` on the configuration object.

The `Actions` service provides an observable of the actions that are dispatched in the app.
We can use the `ofType` operator to filter the actions by type.

<Code code={exampleEffects} lang="ts" />

<Aside type="caution">
It is important to handle errors in effects as any uncaught error will kill the effect. We must return an `Observable<Action>` from `catchError` or use the `EMPTY` observable.
</Aside>

### Features

Each slice of state needs a unique name (the property key where the state will live on the global state object).
We can use the `createFeature` function to tie a reducer to a name.
It will also create selectors for selecting the whole slice and each property of it.
If we need more selectors we can use the `extraSelectors` property.
